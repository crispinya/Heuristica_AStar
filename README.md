# Heuristics and optimization

This is the final project of the Heuristics and optimization course. It is divided in two parts: Firstly, an implementation of an optimization algorithm in Python (using python-constraints) and, secondly, an optimization and solving of a given problem using Java (implementing heuristics and an AStar algorithm).

## General information

### Personal note

	
## Technologies

The part 1 was implemented using:
- Python alongside the python-constraint library.


The part 2 was implemented using:
- Java
	
## Setup

# First Part (parte-1)

TODO

# Second Part (parte-2)
To run de Java Implementation of AStar to solve a given project as .prob the following steps must be followed:

1. Download the code
2. While being inside the parte-2 folder, run the following commands in your console:

```sh
$ ./Cosmos.sh <problema.prob> <heuristic>
```

Where **<heuristic>** will be "heuristica1" or "heuristica2" (or any other string if the heuristic h=0 wants to be executed).

And **<problema.prob>** will be of the type "./ejemplos/problema.prob". The problems availible (at the "ejemplos" folder) are "problema.prob", "problema1.prob", "problema2.prob", "problema3.prob" and "problema4.prob". More problems can be created.

A real example of the command could be:

```sh
$ ./Cosmos.sh ./ejemplos/problema.prob heuristica1
```
which, as a result, would create two output files: *problema.prob.output* and *problema.prob.statistics*.




## Features

**Current features:**
	* [x] Implementation of AStar algorithm.
	* [x] Null heuristic (h=0).
	* [x] Two heuristics (heuristica1 and heuristica2).
	* [x] Creation of output files.

**Future possible upgrades:**
	* [ ] Implement new and improved heuristics.
	* [ ] Translate the code into English.
